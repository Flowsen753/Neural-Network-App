# Neural-Network-App
A small web app to visualize training impacts of different network architectures and optimization methods solving regression tasks. It is mostly meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials.

You can also use your own data to train on. Just put it in a file with the following .json format

```diff
+ {'inputs': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'labels': [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]}
```

and use the file-loader menu in the upper right corner to include it in the app.
